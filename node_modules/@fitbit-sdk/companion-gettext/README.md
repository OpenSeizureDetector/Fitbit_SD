@fitbit-sdk/companion-gettext
===============

This package provides a factory that creates a gettext method to be used by both the companion and the settings in a Fitbit OS app. This package is imported by [@fitbit/sdk](https://github.com/Fitbit/fitbit-sdk-toolchain) to polyfill the i18n module onto the companion and settings.
